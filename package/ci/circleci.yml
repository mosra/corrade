    # While 1.39.6 supports some WIP variant of SIMD, the finalized support is
    # only since 2.0.18, and then the first non-broken emsdk is 2.0.25. But
    # emsdk ships with Node.js 14, and only Node.js 15+ supports intrinsics
    # that Emscripten 2.0.18 can produce, so we have to install our own in
    # order to actually test the SIMD code. Node.js upgrade in emsdk itself is
    # tracked in https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk/issues/1064, as of
    # October 2024 it's still open but emsdk 3.1.36+ contains Node 15, 3.1.42+
    # Node 16 and 3.1.61+ Node 18.
    #
    # HOWEVER, 2.0.25 has something fishy that causes Utility::allocateAligned()
    # to return pointers that aren't actually aligned. That's fixed with
    # 2.0.26, which is what is used here. 2.0.26+ then has a problem in the
    # file embedder, where zero-size files are reported as having 3 bytes. The
    # changelog between 2.0.25 and 2.0.26 doesn't mention anything related, the
    # only related change I found was this, going into 2.0.25 already, and I
    # suspect it's something related to padding in base64 decode. The affected
    # test cases have a corresponding XFAIL.
    #  https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/pull/14526
    # This then happens in *all* versions until 3.1.3 *a year later*, where the
    # "fix" is that they ditched the (broken?) base64 embedding in favor of a
    # binary embed, linked below. Which OTOH breaks Unicode filename support,
    # and that is still the case even with 3.1.67, so there's a corresponding
    # XFAIL for all test cases involving empty files. YAY! TOOLCHAIN FROM HELL!

    # this is done in order to reduce unnecessary credit usage. The base and
    # non-deprecated Linux builds are taken as the main sanity checks. Only
    # if they pass, the rest of the jobs gets gradually executed, with further
    # dependencies especially for the macOS jobs that take the most credits.

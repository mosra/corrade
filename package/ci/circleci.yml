  # Version 3.2.4 is the "new" uploader, but it's a 50 MB Node.js *binary* and
  # doesn't work on ARM64 Linux (or ARM Macs, or FreeBSD for that matter) and

    # 1.39.0 is the oldest on Docker. Anything before 1.39.2 is useless as emar
    # randomly asserts: https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/pull/9742
    # Then, anything before 1.39.6 is useless as well because emar has a
    # filesystem race and randomly complains that a file doesn't exist:
    # https://github.com/mosra/magnum/issues/413,
    # https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/pull/10161
    #
    # Regarding SIMD, while 1.39.6 supports some WIP variant of it, the
    # finalized support is only since 2.0.18 (and then the first non-broken
    # emsdk is 2.0.25). But emsdk ships with Node.js 14, and only Node.js 15
    # supports intrinsics that Emscripten 2.0.18 can produce, so there's no
    # point in even trying, we wouldn't be able to run the tests anyway.

/** @page unit-testing Unit testing with TestSuite

Corrade's test suite is inspired by QtTest framework, but without any need to
process code with meta compiler.

@section unit-testing-class Tester class

First step for creating unit test is to subclass @ref TestSuite::Tester class
and add tester functions to it.
@dontinclude test/MyTest.cpp
@skip struct MyTest
@until };

In constructor we register our test cases:
@skip MyTest::MyTest
@until }
@until }

Now we implement our test cases. The simplest macro is @ref CORRADE_VERIFY(),
which only verifies that expression is true, if not, it exits current test case
(i.e. skips processing the rest of the function) and prints error on error
output:
@skip MyTest::commutativity()
@until }

Next macro is @ref CORRADE_COMPARE(), which takes two values and compares them
for equality:
@skip MyTest::associativity()
@until }

If both values have different type or if we want to force some type for
comparison, we can use @ref CORRADE_COMPARE_AS(). This macro can be used also
for more involved comparison using "pseudo-types", see Comparator class
documentation for more information.
@skip MyTest::sin()
@until }

If you have some unimplemented or broken functionality, but don't want the
test to fail only because of that, you can use @ref CORRADE_EXPECT_FAIL()
macro, which expects all following checks until the end of the scope to fail:
@skip MyTest::pi()
@until }

For things that can't be tested on given platform (or are disabled) you can use
@ref CORRADE_SKIP() macro to indicate that the particular feature is not
tested:
@skip MyTest::bigEndian()
@until }

@section unit-testing-compilation Compilation and running

Lastly, we must not forget to create `main()` function using @ref CORRADE_TEST_MAIN()
macro:
@skipline CORRADE_TEST_MAIN

Now we can compile and run our test using CMake and `corrade_add_test()` macro.
Don't forget to call also `enable_testing()` so `ctest` is able to collect and
run all the tests.
@dontinclude test/CMakeLists.txt
@skip enable_testing
@until corrade_add_test

The test can be run either manually or using `ctest`. When executed, it
produces output similar to this:

    Starting Corrade::Examples::MyTest with 5 test cases...
      FAIL: commutativity() at examples/test/MyTest.cpp on line 52
            Expression 15/3 == 3/15 failed.
        OK: associativity()
        OK: sin()
     XFAIL: pi() at examples/test/MyTest.cpp on line 67
            Need better approximation. pi and 3.14 are not equal.
        OK: pi()
      SKIP: bigEndian() at examples/test/MyTest.cpp on line 72
            No affordable big endian machines exist to test this properly.
    Finished Corrade::Examples::MyTest with 1 errors out of 5 checks.

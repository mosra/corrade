calling @ref join() on the result will give back the original argument.

@brief Glob directory contents
@m_since_latest

Expands upon @ref list() by allowing wildcard patterns in the path. An `*`
matches zero or more characters, a `?` matches exactly one characters. As with
@ref list(), the returned names are always relative to the last path component
of @p pattern. If @p path is not a directory or it can't be opened, prints a
message to @ref Error and returns @ref Containers::NullOpt. Usage examples:

-   @cpp "path/‌*" @ce lists contents of `path`. Equivalent to calling
    @ref list() with @cpp "path" @ce and with @ref ListFlag::SkipDotAndDotDot
    on Unix systems. On Windows it's equivalent to @ref list() with empty
    @ref ListFlags as the system doesn't have any special treatment for files
    starting with a dot.
-   @cpp "path/‌.*" @ce lists files starting with a dot in `path`, including
    `.` and `..` directories. Equivalent to calling @ref list() with
    @cpp "path" @ce and empty @ref ListFlags on both Unix systems and Windows.
-   @cpp "path/‌*.txt" @ce returns all names ending with `.txt` in `path`.
    If @ref GlobFlag::SkipDirectories is not set, this may include not just
    files, but also directories.
-   @cpp "path/tile2?.jpg" @ce would match for example `tile20.jpg` to
    `tile29.jpg` but not `tile2.jpg` or `tile205.jpg`.

The function is implemented using platform-specific APIs. While the subset
shown above is guaranteed to work in a cross-platform way, behavior with other
wildcard specifiers may differ between platforms. Behavior with wildcards
appearing in the path instead of the filename is unspecified.

Expects that the @p path is in UTF-8. If it's already
@ref Containers::StringViewFlag::NullTerminated, it's passed to system APIs
directly, otherwise a null-terminated copy is allocated first. On Windows the

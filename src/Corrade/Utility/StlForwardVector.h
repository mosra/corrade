@brief Forward declaration for @ref std::vector
@m_since{2019,10}

On @ref CORRADE_TARGET_LIBCXX "libc++" (3.9.0 and up) includes a lightweight
implementation-specific STL header containing just the forward declaration of
@ref std::vector. On @ref CORRADE_TARGET_LIBSTDCXX "libstdc++",
@ref CORRADE_TARGET_DINKUMWARE "MSVC STL" and other implementations where
forward declaration is not possible or is unknown is equivalent to
@cpp #include <vector> @ce.

<b></b>

@m_class{m-block m-success}

@par Single-header version
    This header is also available as a single-header, dependency-less
    [CorradeStlForwardVector.h](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-singles/tree/master/CorradeStlForwardVector.h)
    library in the Magnum Singles repository for easier integration into your
    projects. See @ref corrade-singles for more information.

@see @ref Corrade/Utility/StlForwardArray.h,
    @ref Corrade/Utility/StlForwardString.h,
    @ref Corrade/Utility/StlForwardTuple.h,
    @ref Corrade/Utility/StlMath.h

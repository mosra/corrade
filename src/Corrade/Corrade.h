@brief C++ standard version

Expands to `__cplusplus` macro on all sane compilers; on MSVC uses `_MSVC_LANG`

-   @cpp 201703 @ce when C++17 is used
-   @cpp 202002 @ce when C++20 is used
-   greater than @cpp 202002 @ce when C++2b is used

Note that compilers that don't have full support for given standard may not
return the exact value, in which case it's recommended to check that the
reported value is *greater* than the previous standard, for example
@cpp #if CORRADE_CXX_STANDARD > 201703 @ce to test whether compiling as C++20.

@ref std::is_trivially_move_assignable family of traits is not implemented
[on libstdc++ below version 5](https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-5/changes.html).
Instead, legacy @cpp std::has_trivial_default_constructor @ce,
@cpp std::has_trivial_copy_constructor @ce and
@cpp std::has_trivial_copy_assign @ce are available, with slightly different
semantics (see e.g. https://stackoverflow.com/q/12754886 for more information).
From libstdc++ 5 onwards these are marked as deprecated and
[libstdc++ 7 removes them](https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-7/changes.html), so
alternatively there are @cpp __has_trivial_constructor() @ce,
@cpp __has_trivial_copy() @ce and @cpp __has_trivial_assign() @ce builtins that
don't produce any deprecated warnings and are available until GCC 9 / Clang 10
at least --- however note that for SFINAE you need to wrap them in
@ref std::integral_constant as otherwise GCC would throw errors similar to the
following:

@m_class{m-console-wrap}

@code{.shell-session}
error: use of built-in trait ‘__has_trivial_copy(T)’ in function signature; use library traits instead
@endcode

This macro is defined if the standard variants are *not* available.
Unfortunately, when libstdc++ is used through Clang, there's no way to check
for its version until libstdc++ 7, which added the `_GLIBCXX_RELEASE` macro.
That means, when using Clang with libstdc++ 5 or 6, it will still report those
traits as being unavailable. Both libc++ and MSVC STL have these traits in all
versions supported by Corrade, so there the macro is defined always.

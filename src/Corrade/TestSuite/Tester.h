@brief Base class for tests and benchmarks

Supports colored output, instanced (or data-driven) tests, repeated tests (e.g.
for testing race conditions) and benchmarks, which can either use one of the
builtin measurement functions (such as wall time, CPU time or CPU cycle count)
or any user-provided custom measurement function (for example measuring
allocations, memory usage, GPU timings etc.). In addition, the behavior of the
test execution can be configured  via many command-line and environment
options.

Make sure to first go through the @ref testsuite tutorial for initial overview
and step-by-step introduction. Below is a more detailed description of all
provided functionality.

@section TestSuite-Tester-basic Basic testing workflow

A test starts with deriving the @ref Tester class. The test cases are
parameter-less @cpp void @ce member functions that are added using @ref addTests()
in the constructor and the @cpp main() @ce function is created using
@ref CORRADE_TEST_MAIN(). The goal is to have as little boilerplate as
possible, thus the test usually  consists of only one `*.cpp` file with no
header and the derived type is a @cpp struct @ce to avoid having to write
@cpp public @ce keywords. It's also advised to wrap everything except the
@ref CORRADE_TEST_MAIN() macro in an unnamed namespace, as that will make the
compiler tell you about accidentally unused test cases or variables.

@snippet testsuite-basic.cpp 0

The above gives the following output:

@include testsuite-basic.ansi

Actual testing is done via various @ref CORRADE_VERIFY(), @ref CORRADE_COMPARE(),
@ref CORRADE_COMPARE_AS() and other macros. If some comparison in given test
case fails, a @cb{.ansi} [1;31mFAIL @ce with concrete file, line and
additional diagnostic is printed to the output and the test case is exited
without executing the remaining statements. Otherwise, if all comparisons in
given test case pass, an @cb{.ansi} [1;39mOK @ce is printed. The main
difference between these macros is the kind of diagnostic output they print
when comparison fails --- for example a simple expression failure reported by
@ref CORRADE_VERIFY() is enough when checking for non-@cpp nullptr @ce value,
but for comparing two strings you may want to use @ref CORRADE_COMPARE() so you
can not only see that they differ, but also *how* they differ.

Additionally there are @ref CORRADE_SKIP(), @ref CORRADE_EXPECT_FAIL() and
@ref CORRADE_EXPECT_FAIL_IF() control flow helpers that allow you to say for
example that a particular test was skipped due to missing functionality on
given platform (printing a @cb{.ansi} [1;39mSKIP @ce in the output and exiting
the test case right after the statement) or documenting that some algorithm
produces incorrect result due to a bug, printing an @cb{.ansi} [1;33mXFAIL @ce.
Passing a test while failure is expected is treated as an error
(@cb{.ansi} [1;31mXPASS @ce), which can be helpful to ensure the assumptions
in the tests don't get stale. Expected failures can be also disabled globally
via a command-line option `--no-xfail` or via environment variable,
@ref TestSuite-Tester-command-line "see below".

Finally, while it's possible to use @ref Utility::Debug and any other APIs for
printing to the standard output, using the @ref CORRADE_INFO() or
@ref CORRADE_WARN() macros will make the output prefixed with
@cb{.ansi} [1;39mINFO @ce or @cb{.ansi} [1;33mWARN @ce, name of the test case
as well as file/line information. The @ref CORRADE_FAIL_IF() macro is then
useful as an alternative to @ref CORRADE_VERIFY() / @ref CORRADE_COMPARE() when
the implicit diagnostic message is insufficient --- if the condition fails,
it'll just print given message prefixed with @cb{.ansi} [1;31mFAIL @ce and the
test case is exited.

The only reason why those are macros and not member functions is the ability to
gather class/function/file/line/expression information via the preprocessor for
printing the test output and exact location of possible test failure. If none
of the @ref CORRADE_VERIFY(), @ref CORRADE_COMPARE() plus variants,
@ref CORRADE_FAIL_IF() or @ref CORRADE_SKIP()  macros is encountered when
running the test case, the test case is reported as invalid, with
@cb{.ansi} [1;33m? @ce in the output, and that causes the whole test run to
fail as well. This is done in order to prevent accidents where nothing actually
gets verified.

The test cases are numbered in the output and those numbers can be used on the
command-line to whitelist/blacklist the test cases with `--only`/`--skip`,
randomly reorder them using `--shuffle` and more,
@ref TestSuite-Tester-command-line "see below" for details. In total, when all
test cases pass, the executable exits with `0` return code, in case of failure
or invalid test case it exits with `1` to make it possible to run the tests in
batch (such as CMake CTest). By default, after a failure, the testing continues
with the other test cases, you can abort after first failure using
`--abort-on-fail` command-line option.

Useful but not immediately obvious is the possibility to use templated member
functions as test cases, for example when testing a certain algorithm on
different data types:

@snippet testsuite-templated.cpp 0

And the corresponding output:

@include testsuite-templated.ansi

This works with all `add*()` functions though please note that current C++11
compilers (at least GCC and Clang) are not able to properly detect class type
when passing only templated functions to it, so you may need to specify the
type explicitly. Also, there is no easy and portable way to get function name
with template parameters so by default it will be just the function name, but
you can call @ref setTestCaseName() to specify a full name.

@section TestSuite-Tester-instanced Instanced tests

Often you have an algorithm which you need to test on a variety of inputs or
corner cases. One solution is to use a for-cycle inside the test case to test
on all inputs, but then the diagnostic on error will not report which input is
to blame. Another solution is to duplicate the test case multiple times for all
the different inputs, but that becomes a maintenance nightmare pretty quickly.
Making the function with a non-type template parameter is also a solution, but
that's not possible to do for all types and with huge input sizes it is often
not worth the increased compilation times. Fortunately, there is an
@ref addInstancedTests() that comes for the rescue:

@snippet testsuite-instanced.cpp 0

Corresponding output:

@include testsuite-instanced.ansi

The tester class just gives you an instance index via @ref testCaseInstanceId()
and it's up to you whether you use it as an offset to some data array or
generate an input using it, the above example is just a hint how one might use
it. Each instance is printed to the output separately and if one instance
fails, it doesn't stop the other instances from being executed. Similarly to
the templated tests, @ref setTestCaseDescription() allows you to set a
human-readable description of given instance. If not called, the instances are
just numbered in the output.

See also the @ref TestCaseDescriptionSourceLocation class for improved
file/line diagnostics for instanced test cases.

@section TestSuite-Tester-iteration-annotations Testing in a loop

While instanced tests are usually the go-to solution when testing on a larger
set of data, sometimes you need to loop over a few values and check them one by
one. When such test fails, it's often hard to know which particular value
caused the failure. To fix that, you can use the @ref CORRADE_ITERATION() macro
to annotate current iteration in case of a failure. It works with any type
printable via @ref Utility::Debug and handles nested loops as well. Silly
example:

@snippet testsuite-iteration.cpp 0

On failure, the iteration value(s) will be printed next to the file/line info:

@include testsuite-iteration.ansi

This macro isn't limited to just loops, it can be used to provide more context
to just any check. See also @ref Compare::Container for a convenient way of
comparing container contents.

@section TestSuite-Tester-repeated Repeated tests

A complementary feature to instanced tests are repeated tests using
@ref addRepeatedTests(), useful for example to repeatedly call one function
10000 times to increase probability of potential race conditions. The
difference from instanced tests is that all repeats are treated as executing
the same code and thus only the overall result is reported in the output. Also
unlike instanced tests, if a particular repeat fails, no further repeats are
executed. The test output contains the number of executed repeats after the
test case name, prefixed by @cb{.ansi} [1;39m@ @ce. Example of testing race
conditions with multiple threads accessing the same variable:

@snippet testsuite-repeated.cpp 0

Depending on various factors, here is one possible output:

@include testsuite-repeated.ansi

Similarly to @ref testCaseInstanceId() there is @ref testCaseRepeatId() which
gives repeat index. Use with care, however, as the repeated tests are assumed
to execute the same code every time. On
@ref TestSuite-Tester-command-line "the command line" it is possible to
increase repeat count via `--repeat-every`. In addition there is `--repeat-all`
which behaves as like all `add*()` functions in the constructor were called
multiple times in a loop. Combined with `--shuffle` this can be used to run the
test cases multiple times in a random order to uncover potential unwanted
interactions and order-dependent bugs.

It's also possible to combine instanced and repeated tests using
@ref addRepeatedInstancedTests().

@section TestSuite-Tester-advanced-comparisons Advanced comparisons

While the diagnostic provided by @ref CORRADE_COMPARE() is definitely better
than just knowing that something failed, the @ref CORRADE_COMPARE_AS() and
@ref CORRADE_COMPARE_WITH() macros allow for advanced comparison features in
specialized cases. The @ref Compare namespace contains various builtin
comparators, some of which are listed below. It's also possible to implement
custom comparators for your own use cases --- see the @ref Comparator class for
details.

<ul>
<li>
@ref Compare::Container and @relativeref{Compare,SortedContainer} can be used
for convenient comparison of large containers. Compared to plain
@ref CORRADE_COMPARE() Its diagnostic will show where exactly the containers
differ, which becomes useful with large data sizes:

@snippet TestSuite.cpp Compare-Container
</li>
<li>
@ref Compare::String provides multi-line diffs; @relativeref{Compare,StringHasPrefix}, @relativeref{Compare,StringHasSuffix},
@relativeref{Compare,StringContains} and @relativeref{Compare,StringNotContains}
provide a better diagnostic compared to e.g. checking
@ref Containers::StringView::hasPrefix() with @ref CORRADE_VERIFY():

@snippet TestSuite.cpp Compare-StringHasPrefix
</li>
<li>
@ref Compare::File, @relativeref{Compare,FileToString} and
@relativeref{Compare,StringToFile} allow you to compare files without having to
manually read them:

@snippet TestSuite.cpp Compare-File
</li>
<li>
@ref Compare::Less, @relativeref{Compare,Greater}, @relativeref{Compare,Around}
and others from the @ref Corrade/TestSuite/Compare/Numeric.h header allow you
to do numeric comparisons that again provide better failure reporting compared
to checking an expression result with @ref CORRADE_VERIFY():

@snippet TestSuite.cpp Compare-around-just-one
</li>
<li>
Finally, [Magnum](https://magnum.graphics) has more comparators, including a
@m_class{m-doc-external} [DebugTools::CompareImage](https://doc.magnum.graphics/magnum/classMagnum_1_1DebugTools_1_1CompareImage.html)
that's able to fuzzy-compare two images pixel-by-pixel and visualize the
difference as an ASCII art directly in the console.
</li>
</ul>

@section TestSuite-Tester-save-diagnostic Saving diagnostic files

On comparison failure, it's sometimes desirable to inspect the generated data
with an external tool. Or, in case the expected test data need to be updated,
it's easier to copy over the generated data to the original file than applying
changes manually. To make this easier without needing to add file-saving to the
test itself, pass a path to the `--save-diagnostic`
@ref TestSuite-Tester-command-line "command-line option". Comparators that
operate with files (such as @ref Compare::File or @ref Compare::StringToFile)
will then use this path to save the actual data under the same filename as the
expected file, notifying you about the operation with a
@cb{.ansi} [1;32mSAVED @ce message:

@include testsuite-save-diagnostic.ansi

Note that this functionality is not restricted to just saving the actual
compared data (or to comparison failures) --- third-party comparators can use
it for generating diffs or providing further diagnostic meant to be viewed
externally. See the @ref TestSuite-Comparator-save-diagnostic "Comparator"
class for further information.

@section TestSuite-Tester-benchmark Benchmarks

Besides verifying code correctness, it's possible to measure code performance.
Unlike correctness tests, the benchmark results are hard to reason about using
only automated means, so there are no macros for verifying benchmark results
and instead the measured values are just printed to the output for users to
see. Benchmarks can be added using @ref addBenchmarks(), the actual benchmark
loop is marked by @ref CORRADE_BENCHMARK() and the results are printed to
output with @cb{.ansi} [1;39mBENCH @ce identifier. Example benchmark comparing
performance of inverse square root implementations:

@snippet testsuite-benchmark.cpp 0

Note that it's not an error to add one test/benchmark multiple times --- here
it is used to have the same code benchmarked with different timers. Possible
output:

@include testsuite-benchmark.ansi

The number passed to @ref addBenchmarks() is equivalent to repeat count passed
to @ref addRepeatedTests() and specifies measurement sample count. The number
passed to @ref CORRADE_BENCHMARK() is number of iterations of the inner loop in
one sample measurement to amortize the overhead and error caused by clock
precision --- the faster the measured code is the more iterations it needs. The
measured value is then divided by that number to represent cost of a single
iteration. The @ref testCaseRepeatId() returns current sample index and can be
used to give some input variation to the test. By default the benchmarks
measure wall clock time, see @ref BenchmarkType for other types of builtin
benchmarks. The default benchmark type can be also overridden
@ref TestSuite-Tester-command-line "on the command-line" via `--benchmark`.

It's possible to use all @ref CORRADE_VERIFY(), @ref CORRADE_COMPARE() etc.
verification macros inside the benchmark to check pre/post-conditions. If one
of them fails, the benchmark is treated in the output just like a failing test,
with no benchmark results being printed out. Keep in mind, however, that those
macros have some overhead, so try to not use them inside the benchmark loop.

The benchmark output is calculated from all samples except the first discarded
samples. By default that's one sample, `--benchmark-discard` and `--repeat-every`
@ref TestSuite-Tester-command-line "command-line options" can be used to
override how many samples are taken and how many of them are discarded at
first. In the output, the used sample count and sample size is printed after
test case name, prefixed with `@`. The output contains mean value and a sample
standard deviation, calculated as: @f[
    \begin{array}{rcl}
        \bar{x} & = & \dfrac{1}{N} \sum\limits_{i=1}^N x_i \\ \\
        \sigma_x & = & \sqrt{\dfrac{1}{N-1} \sum\limits_{i=1}^N \left( x_i - \bar{x} \right)^2}
    \end{array}
@f]

Different benchmark type have different units. Depending on value magnitude,
larger units may be used as documented in @ref BenchmarkUnits. For easier
visual recognition of the values, by default the sample standard deviation is
colored yellow if it is larger than 5% of the absolute value of the mean and
red if it  is larger than 25% of the absolute value of the mean. This can be
overridden @ref TestSuite-Tester-command-line "on the command-line" via
`--benchmark-yellow` and `--benchmark-red`. See
@ref TestSuite-Tester-running-benchmark-noise below for various ways of
achieving more stable results.

It's possible to have instanced benchmarks as well, see
@ref addInstancedBenchmarks().

@section TestSuite-Tester-benchmark-custom Custom benchmarks

It's possible to specify a custom pair of functions for intiating the benchmark
and returning the result using @ref addCustomBenchmarks(). The benchmark end
function returns an unsigned 64-bit integer indicating measured amount in units
given by @ref BenchmarkUnits. To further describe the value being measured you
can call @ref setBenchmarkName() in the benchmark begin function. Contrived
example of benchmarking number of copies when using @ref std::vector::push_back():

@snippet testsuite-benchmark-custom.cpp 0

Running the benchmark shows that calling @ref std::vector::push_back() "push_back()"
for 10 thousand elements actually causes the copy constructor to be called 26
thousand times:

@include testsuite-benchmark-custom.ansi

@section TestSuite-Tester-setup-teardown Specifying setup/teardown routines

While the common practice in C++ is to use RAII for resource lifetime
management, sometimes you may need to execute arbitrary code at the beginning
and end of each test case. For this, all @ref addTests(),
@ref addInstancedTests(), @ref addRepeatedTests(), @ref addRepeatedInstancedTests(),
@ref addBenchmarks(), @ref addInstancedBenchmarks(), @ref addCustomBenchmarks()
and @ref addCustomInstancedBenchmarks() have an overload that is additionally
taking a pair of parameter-less @cpp void @ce functions for setup and teardown.
Both functions are called before and after each test case run, independently on
whether the test case passed or failed.

@section TestSuite-Tester-exceptions Catching exceptions

If a test case fails with an unhandled exception, a @cb{.ansi} [1;31mTHROW @ce
is printed on the output, together with a (platform-specific mangled) name of
the exception type and contents of @ref std::exception::what(). No file/line
info is provided in this case, as it's not easily possible to know where the
exception originated from. Only exceptions derived from @ref std::exception are
caught to avoid interfering with serious issues such as memory access errors.
If catching unhandled exceptions is not desired (for example when you want to
do a post-mortem debugging of the stack trace leading to the exception), it can
be disabled with the `--no-catch` @ref TestSuite-Tester-command-line "command-line option".

Apart from the above, the test suite doesn't provide any builtin exception
support --- if it's needed to verify that an exception was or wasn't thrown,
the user is expected to implement a @cpp try {} catch @ce block inside the test
case and verify the desired properties directly.

@section TestSuite-Tester-command-line Command-line options

Command-line options that make sense to be set globally for multiple test cases
are also configurable via environment variables for greater flexibility when
for example running the tests in a batch via `ctest`.

Usage:

@code{.shell-session}
./my-test [-h|--help] [-c|--color on|off|auto] [--skip N1,N2-N3â¦]
    [--skip-tests] [--skip-benchmarks] [--only N1,N2-N3â¦] [--shuffle]
    [--repeat-every N] [--repeat-all N] [--abort-on-fail] [--no-xfail]
    [--no-catch] [--save-diagnostic PATH] [--verbose] [--benchmark TYPE]
    [--benchmark-discard N] [--benchmark-yellow N] [--benchmark-red N]
@endcode

Arguments:

-   `-h`, `--help` --- display this help message and exit
-   `-c`, `--color on|off|auto` --- colored output (environment:
    `CORRADE_TEST_COLOR`, default: `auto`). The `auto` option enables color
    output in case an interactive terminal is detected. Note that on Windows it
    is possible to output colors only directly to an interactive terminal
    unless @ref CORRADE_UTILITY_USE_ANSI_COLORS is defined.
-   `--skip N1,N2-N3â¦` --- skip test cases with given numbers. See
    @ref Utility::String::parseNumberSequence() for syntax description.
-   `--skip-tests` --- skip all tests (environment:
    `CORRADE_TEST_SKIP_TESTS=ON|OFF`)
-   `--skip-benchmarks` --- skip all benchmarks (environment:
    `CORRADE_TEST_SKIP_BENCHMARKS=ON|OFF`)
-   `--only N1,N2-N3â¦` --- run only test cases with given numbers. See
    @ref Utility::String::parseNumberSequence() for syntax description.
-   `--shuffle` --- randomly shuffle test case order (environment:
    `CORRADE_TEST_SHUFFLE=ON|OFF`)
-   `--repeat-every N` --- repeat every test case N times (environment:
    `CORRADE_TEST_REPEAT_EVERY`, default: `1`)
-   `--repeat-all N` --- repeat all test cases N times (environment:
    `CORRADE_TEST_REPEAT_ALL`, default: `1`)
-   `-X`, `--abort-on-fail` --- abort after first failure (environment:
    `CORRADE_TEST_ABORT_ON_FAIL=ON|OFF`)
-   `--no-xfail` --- disallow expected failures (environment:
    `CORRADE_TEST_NO_XFAIL=ON|OFF`)
-   `--no-catch` --- don't catch standard exceptions (environment:
    `CORRADE_TEST_NO_CATCH=ON|OFF`)
-   `-S`, `--save-diagnostic PATH` --- save diagnostic files to given path
    (environment: `CORRADE_TEST_SAVE_DIAGNOSTIC`)
-   `-v`, `--verbose` --- enable verbose output (environment:
    `CORRADE_TEST_VERBOSE=ON|OFF`). Note that there isn't any corresponding
    "quiet" option, if you want to see just the failures, redirect standard
    output away.
-   `--benchmark TYPE` --- default benchmark type (environment:
    `CORRADE_TEST_BENCHMARK`). Supported benchmark types:
    -   `wall-time` --- wall time spent
    -   `cpu-time` --- CPU time spent
    -   `cpu-cycles` --- CPU cycles spent (x86 only, gives zero result
        elsewhere)
-   `--benchmark-discard N` --- discard first N measurements of each benchmark
    (environment: `CORRADE_TEST_BENCHMARK_DISCARD`, default: `1`)
-   `--benchmark-yellow N` --- deviation threshold for marking benchmark yellow
    (environment: `CORRADE_TEST_BENCHMARK_YELLOW`, default: `0.05`)
-   `--benchmark-red N` --- deviation threshold for marking benchmark red
    (environment: `CORRADE_TEST_BENCHMARK_RED`, default: `0.25`)

@section TestSuite-Tester-running Compiling and running tests

In general, just compiling the executable and linking it to the TestSuite
library is enough, no further setup is needed. When running, the test produces
output to standard output / standard error and exits with non-zero code in case
of a test failure.

@subsection TestSuite-Tester-running-cmake Using CMake

If you are using CMake, there's a convenience @ref corrade-cmake-add-test "corrade_add_test()"
CMake macro that creates the executable, links `Corrade::TestSuite` library to
it and adds it to CTest. Besides that it is able to link other arbitrary
libraries to the executable and specify a list of files that the tests used. It
provides additional useful features on various platforms:

-   On Windows, the macro links the test executable to the @ref main "Corrade::Main"
    library for ANSI color support, UTF-8 argument parsing and UTF-8 output
    encoding.
-   If compiling for Emscripten, using @ref corrade-cmake-add-test "corrade_add_test()"
    makes CTest run the resulting `*.js` file via Node.js. Also it is able to
    bundle all files specified in `FILES` into the virtual Emscripten
    filesystem, making it easy to run file-based tests on this platform; all
    environment options are passed through as well. The macro also creates a
    runner for manual testing in a browser, see
    @ref TestSuite-Tester-running-emscripten-browser "below" for more
    information.
-   If Xcode projects are generated via CMake and @ref CORRADE_TESTSUITE_TARGET_XCTEST
    is enabled, @ref corrade-cmake-add-test "corrade_add_test()" makes the test
    executables in a way compatible with XCTest, making it easy to run them
    directly from Xcode. Running the tests via `ctest` will also use XCTest.
-   If building for Android, using @ref corrade-cmake-add-test "corrade_add_test()"
    will make CTest upload the test executables and all files specified in `FILES`
    onto the device or emulator via `adb`, run it there with all environment
    options passed through as well and transfers test results back to the host.
    @attention If a test fails, the executable and all files it references is
        kept in `/data/local/tmp` to make it possible to debug / re-run the
        test directly. Note that in the extreme case this may cause the
        internal storage to get filled over time. Rebooting the device or
        doing system cleanup will wipe the temp directory.

.

Example of using the @ref corrade-cmake-add-test "corrade_add_test()" macro is
below. The test executable will get built from the specified source with the
libJPEG library linked and the `*.jpg` files will be available on desktop,
Emscripten and Android in path specified in `JPEG_TEST_DIR` that was saved into
the `configure.h` file inside current build directory:

@snippet testsuite.cmake 0

@subsection TestSuite-Tester-running-android Manually running the tests on Android

If not using CMake CTest, Android tests can be run manually. When you have
developer-enabled Android device connected or Android emulator running, you can
use ADB to upload the built test to device temp directory and run it there:

@code{.sh}
adb push <path-to-the-test-build>/MyTest /data/local/tmp
adb shell /data/local/tmp/MyTest
@endcode

You can also use @cb{.sh} adb shell @ce to log directly into the device shell
and continue from there. All @ref TestSuite-Tester-command-line "command-line arguments"
are supported.

@note Keep in mind that older versions of ADB and Android do not correctly
    propagate the exit code to caller, which may result in your test failures
    being silently ignored. See [Android Issue 3254](https://web.archive.org/web/20160806094132/https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=3254)
    for possible workarounds. The @ref corrade-cmake-add-test "corrade_add_test()"
    CMake macro also works around this issue.

@subsection TestSuite-Tester-running-emscripten Manually running the tests on Emscripten

When not using CMake CTest, Emscripten tests can be run directly using Node.js.
Emscripten sideloads the WebAssembly or asm.js binary files from current
working directory, so it's needed to @cb{.sh} cd @ce into the test build
directory first:

@code{.sh}
cd <test-build-directory>
node MyTest.js
@endcode

See also the `--embed-files` [emcc option](https://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/docs/porting/files/packaging_files.html)
for a possibility to bundle test files with the executable.

@subsection TestSuite-Tester-running-emscripten-browser Running Emscripten tests in a browser

Besides running tests using Node.js, it's possible to run each test case
manually in a browser. Browsers require the executables to be accessed via a
webserver --- if you have Python installed, you can simply start serving the
contents of your build directory using the following command:

@code{.sh}
cd <test-build-directory>
python -m http.server
@endcode

The webserver is then available at http://localhost:8000. It supports directory
listing, so you can navigate to each test case runner HTML file (look for e.g.
`MyTest.html`). Unfortunately it's at the moment not possible to run all
browser tests in a batch or automate the process in any other way.

@subsection TestSuite-Tester-running-benchmark-noise Mitigating noise in CPU benchmark results

CPU frequency scaling, which is often enabled by default for power saving
reasons, can add a lot of noise to benchmarks that measure time. Picking a
higher iteration and repeat count in @ref CORRADE_BENCHMARK() and
@ref addBenchmarks() has the effect of putting more strain on the system,
forcing it to run at a higher frequency for longer period of time, which
together with having more data to average tends to produce more stable results.
However it's often impractical to hardcode them to a too high value as it hurts
iteration times, and the repeat count needed for stable results may vary wildly
between debug and release builds.

To quickly increase repeat count when running the test it's possible to use
the `--repeat-every` @ref TestSuite-Tester-command-line "command-line option"
or the corresponding environment variable. The `--repeat-all` option, possibly
combined with `--shuffle`, will result in benchmarks being run and appearing in
the output several times and possibly in random order, which could uncover
various otherwise hard-to-detect implicit dependencies between the code being
measured and application or system state such as cold caches.

On Linux or Android the test runner will attempt to query the CPU frequency
scaling governor. If it's not set to `performance`, the benchmark output will
contain a warning, with `-v` / `--verbose` showing a concrete suggestion how to
fix it. Switching to a performance governor can be done with `cpupower` on
Linux:

@code{.sh}
sudo cpupower frequency-set --governor performance
@endcode

An equivalent command on Android is the following,
which requires a rooted device:
*/
/// <b></b>
///
/// @code{.sh}
/// echo performance | tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor
/// @endcode

/**
@brief Instanced test case description with source location
@m_since_latest

When used instead of @ref Containers::StringView or @cpp const char* @ce to
define @ref TestSuite-Tester-instanced "instanced test case descriptions", any
messages printed to the output will contain also the file/line info of where
the instance data were defined in addition of file/line location from where the
message originated:

@m_class{m-code-figure}

@parblock

@snippet testsuite-description-source-location.cpp 0

<b></b>

@m_class{m-nopad m-console-wrap}

@include testsuite-description-source-location.ansi

@endparblock

Useful especially in combination with terminals that are capable of treating
the location information as a direct link to an IDE or text editor --- clicking
on @cb{.shell-session} â¦/PathTest.cpp:55 @ce will open the editor at the line
containing the @cpp "two extensions" @ce test case instance.

At the moment, this feature is available on GCC at least since version 4.8
(although it may not be giving correct results until version 12), Clang 9+ and
MSVC 2019 16.6 and newer. Elsewhere it behaves like if just a regular
@ref Tester::setTestCaseDescription(Containers::StringView) was used. You can
check for its availability using the
@ref CORRADE_SOURCE_LOCATION_BUILTINS_SUPPORTED predefined macro.

       duplicates. To avoid that for the most part, the definition is wrapped
       in an anonymous namespace and thus each compile unit should get a

        // IsComplete<Incomplete>::value == false
        struct ForwardDeclared {};
        // IsComplete<Incomplete>::value == true

       where this would be a problem, but let's just hope nobody tries to abuse

       used only in static_assert() inside Pointer and nowhere else. */

/**
@brief Lightweight unique pointer

An alternative to @ref std::unique_ptr from C++11, provides an owning move-only
wrapper over a pointer of type @p T, calling @cpp delete @ce on it on
destruction. The @ref pointer() convenience function also provides an
equivalent for C++14 @ref std::make_unique(), but on C++11 as well. Can be also
thought of as a heap-allocated counterpart to @ref Optional.

Compared to @ref std::unique_ptr, this class does proper @cpp const @ce
propagation as would be expected from any other owning container like
@ref Array or @ref String --- i.e., it's only possible to mutate the owned data
if the instance is not @cpp const @ce. There's no STL functionality with such
behavior except for the proposed @m_class{m-doc-external} [std::indirect_value](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/p1950r1.html).

Unlike @ref std::unique_ptr, this class does not provide custom deleters,
doesn't work with arrays and doesn't have a @cpp constexpr @ce API. On the
other hand that makes it fairly simple and lightweight. If you need a custom
deleter, use either @ref ScopeGuard or the standard @ref std::unique_ptr. For
owning array wrappers use @ref Array, which maintains a size information and
also supports custom deleters.

@section Containers-Pointer-incomplete-types Usage with incomplete types

The @ref Pointer class can wrap an incomplete (forward-declared) type, for
example to use it for the [PIMPL idiom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opaque_pointer).
The type is expected to be defined when the destructor is called or when using
@ref reset(), as otherwise calling @cpp delete @ce on a pointer to an
incomplete type wouldn't call its destructor, leading to resource leaks. In
practice it means that a PIMPL class has to define its copy/move constructors,
assignments and the destructor in the source file as well instead of relying on
them being added implicitly by the compiler. For example, this is how a header
with the forward-declared @cpp struct State @ce would have to look like,
explicitly declaring but *not defining* a move constructor, destructor and move
assignment:

@snippet Containers.cpp Pointer-pimpl-header

The defaulted move constructor, destructor, and move assignment would then be
in the source file together with the definition of `State`:

@snippet Containers.cpp Pointer-pimpl-source

@section Containers-Pointer-stl STL compatibility

Instances of @ref Pointer are implicitly move-convertible to and from
@ref std::unique_ptr if you include @ref Corrade/Containers/PointerStl.h. The
conversion is provided in a separate header to avoid unconditional
@cpp #include <memory> @ce, which significantly affects compile times.
Additionally, the @ref pointer(T&&) overload also allows for such a conversion.
Example:

@snippet Containers-stl.cpp Pointer

@m_class{m-block m-success}

@par Single-header version
    This class is also available as a single-header, dependency-less
    [CorradePointer.h](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-singles/tree/master/CorradePointer.h)
    library in the Magnum Singles repository for easier integration into your
    projects. See @ref corrade-singles for more information. The above
    mentioned STL compatibility is included as well, but disabled by default.
    Enable it by specifying @cpp #define CORRADE_POINTER_STL_COMPATIBILITY @ce
    before including the file. Including it multiple times with different
    macros defined works as well.

similar to @ref std::make_unique() from C++14. The following two lines are
equivalent:

@snippet Containers.cpp pointer-inplace

@attention Note that for types that are constructible from their own pointer
    the call would get ambiguous between this function and @ref pointer(T*).
    Such case is forbidden at compile time in order to prevent potentially
    dangerous behavior and you need to explicitly use the @ref Pointer
    constructor instead.

@see @ref pointer(T*), @ref optional(Args&&... args)

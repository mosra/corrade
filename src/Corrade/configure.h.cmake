/* <ciso646> is removed in C++20 and replaced by <version>. As of August 2023
   MSVC 2022 warns that it's removed when using C++20, libc++ version 19 so far
   doesn't warn. Unfortunately libstdc++ as of version 15 warns already when
   using C++17, which is extremely annoying, because I can no longer expect
   that all C++17-enabled compilers have <ciso646> that works without warnings
   and all C++20-enabled compilers have <version> -- and *assuming* that all
   C++17-enabled compilers have <version> isn't going to work, because one can
   for example use a newer Clang with an older libstdc++ that doesn't have
   <version> yet.

   I also cannot make an exception for, say, _GLIBCXX_RELEASE >= 15 because I
   kinda need to include <ciso646> or <version> to get to the value of this
   macro, turning this into a stupid chicken-or-egg problem. Why the fuck did
   you have to *remove* the old header in the first place, just three years
   after it was marked deprecated, and, secondly, why THE FUCK it has to warn
   now, giving the codebase no headroom at all to paper over toolchain version
   differences?? Not every project is always on the latest GCC, for fucks sake.

   The only way to do this semi-sanely is thus first checking if __has_include
   is implemented by the compiler (because, guess what, it's *also* new in
   C++17, thus it may happen that <version> is there but __has_include not yet
   or vice versa, or any other combination, and __has_include is made in a way
   that its mere presence in a preprocessor expression is a syntax error if not
   implemented by the compiler), and then if it is, and <version> is there, and
   C++17 is used, include <version>, otherwise <ciso646>. Truly a design
   marvel, congratulations everyone involved, needing three paragraphs of
   explanatory comments for a basic STL version check that should have been
   just a single #include line if the involved parties just paused and thought
   for a moment. */
